Difference between promise and async await in Javascript:
1. If a function “funct1” is to executed after the promise,
promise.then(funct1) continues execution of the current function after adding the funct1 call to the callback chain.
If the function “funct1” is to be executed after await,
then await X() suspends execution of the current function and then funct1 is executed.
2. Error-handling in promises are done using then-catch whereas in async await, that is done using try-catch.
3. To read and understand the structure of async await is easier than that in promise.
4. A promise cane have 3 states: resolved, pending or rejected. Async await can have either of two states: resolved or rejected.
